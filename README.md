- main.py: 
This is the entry point of your game. It will initialize Pygame, create a game window, and contain the main game loop where the game's state is updated and rendered repeatedly.

- settings.py: 
This file holds various configuration settings for your game, such as screen dimensions, color constants, font settings, and any other configurable parameters. Keeping these separate from your main game logic makes it easier to adjust settings without digging through your main code.

- game.py: This module contains the Game class. The Game class manages the game state, including starting a new game, handling player turns, checking for win conditions, and transitioning between different states of the game (like game start, in-play, game over).

- player.py: Here, you define a Player class. Each instance of this class represents a player in the game. It should store information specific to each player, such as their hand (the tiles they currently hold), their name or ID, and possibly their score.

- tile.py: The Tile class represents an individual tile. Each tile will have attributes like its number and color. You might also include methods for drawing the tile on the screen.

- board.py: This manages the game board. It should handle the layout of the tiles as they are played during the game, check for valid placements, and possibly store the current state of the game board.

- hand.py: Manages the tiles each player is holding. This could be a part of the Player class, or you could make it a separate class to handle the logic of selecting, sorting, and playing tiles from a player's hand.

- ui.py: Handles the user interface and graphical rendering. This includes drawing the game board, tiles, player hands, and other UI elements like buttons, menus, or scoreboards.
